## Blackjack Project

### Project Description
The goal was to recreate Blackjack as a console command game. There is a dealer, and a player. Each have their own hand, and the player is allowed to make a choice as to hit or stand while the dealer has to follow the rule of "always hit if less than 17 points." This is our our first, very heavy, object oriented thinking program.
